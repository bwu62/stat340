    "text": "6.5 Choose the distribution\n\nFor the following situations, decide what the distribution of \\(X\\) should be. In nearly every case, there are additional assumptions that should be made for the distribution to apply; identify those assumptions (which may or may not hold in practice.)\n\n\nWe shoot basketballs at a basketball hoop, and count the number of shots until we make a basket. Let X denote the number of missed shots. On a normal day we would typically make about 37% of the shots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of missed shots before the first basket, assuming independence, can be modeled by a Geometric random variable with parameter \\(p=.37\\).\n\n\n\n\nIn a local lottery in which a three digit number is selected randomly, let X be the number selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuming that all 3 digit numbers are equally likely (A reasonable assumption) the number selected can be modeled by a discrete uniform distribution with minimum 100 and maximum 999.\n\n\n\n\nWe drop a Styrofoam cup to the floor twenty times, each time recording whether the cup comes to rest perfectly right side up, or not. Let X be the number of times the cup lands perfectly right side up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we drop the cup 20 times, and the result each time is independent with a constant probability of landing right side up, the number of times it does can be modeled by a Binomial random variable with parameters \\(n=20\\) and \\(p\\) (unknown).\n\n\n\n\nWe toss a piece of trash at the garbage can from across the room. If we miss the trash can, we retrieve the trash and try again, continuing to toss until we make the shot.

A certain ship comes to port with 557 cargo containers. Standard practice is to select 10 containers randomly and inspect each one very carefully, classifying it as either having contraband or not. Let X count the number of containers that illegally contain contraband.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnically we should use a hypergeometric random variable for this situation (since it is a small population size of 557), but since we do not cover the hypergeometric the closest random variable we have is the binomial.\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time every year, some migratory birds land in a bush outside for a short rest. On a certain day, we look outside and let X denote the number of birds in the bush.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a discrete random variable, but without other information it’s hard to say. The distribution is likely unimodal and bell-curved. You could probably model this using a normal distribution rounded off to the nearest integer.\n\n\n\n\nWe count the number of rain drops that fall in a circular area on a sidewalk during a ten minute period of a thunder storm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe observation window is the circular area, and the 10 minutes during observation. Assuming the rate of rainfall is constant, the number of raindrops in the circle can be modeled using a Poisson random variable.\n\n\n\n\nWe count the number of moth eggs on our window screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nCounting indicates a discrete random variable. A binomial or a rounded normal distribution may be appropriate, but we lack enough details to be sure.\n\n\n\n\nWe count the number of blades of grass in a one square foot patch of land.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe location of the sprouting grass could be modeled well by a Poisson random variable - the \\(\\lambda\\) parameter would likely be very large, in the range of 1000 or 10000, and as such the distribution would look very much like a normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\nWe count the number of pats on a baby’s back until (s)he burps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we define a geometric random variable, we let \\(X\\) be the number of failures before the first success. The last pat (that causes the burp) is the success in this context. So we could use a geometric random variable, but we would have to add 1 to it in order to count all burps (the failures + 1 success)."

Because \\(\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2^k}=1\\), then it would be possible to define a random variable with support \\(1,2,\\ldots\\) with this pmf.\nFor part c, because \\(p_k/2^k \\leq p_k/2\\), we at least know that \\(\\sum_k p_k\\) is finite, so such a random variable with infinite support is certainly feasible.

Since \\(X\\) an \\(Y\\) are independent, so are \\(X^2\\) and \\(Y\\), and \\(X\\) and \\(Y^2\\). \\(E(X)=E(X^2)=E(X^3)=p\\) and \\(E(Y)=E(Y^2)=E(Y^3)=q\\).

Recall that \\(Var(X)=E(X^2)-\\mu^2\\) so \\(E(X^2)=\\sigma^2+\\mu^2\\) So we can write \\(\\Delta(\\theta)=\\sigma^2 + \\mu^2-2\\theta\\mu + \\theta^2\\) We want to find what value of \\(\\theta\\) minimizes this function - derivative! \\(\\Delta'(\\theta)=-2\\mu+2\\theta=0\\) thus \\(\\theta=\\mu\\) minimizes this.\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) are independent uniform random variables in \\(\\{0,1,\\ldots,100\\}\\).

This is the same calculation for each \\(i\\). So \\(P(Y&gt;l)=\\dfrac{(100-l)^n}{101^n}\\).\n\n\n\n\nConsider a binomial random variable \\(X\\) with parameters \\(n\\) and \\(p\\). \\(p_X(k)={n \\choose k} p^k(1-p)^{n-k}\\).

In our case, \\(p=\\frac12\\). Plugging this in we get \\(\\frac{.5}{.5^2}=2\\)."

    "text": "6.10 GSS Survey III\nThere’s a famous quote about young people, old people, liberals, and conservatives that goes something like:\n\nIf you are not a liberal at 25, you have no heart. If you are not a conservative at 35, you have no brain.\n\nWhether you agree with this proposition or not, it suggests some probabilities we can compute as an exercise. Rather than use the specific ages 25 and 35, let’s define young and old as under 30 or over 65. For these thresholds, I chose round numbers near the 20th and 80th percentiles.

If I pick a random coin from the two, you already know that one of the sides is a head without looking at it. Somehow then, when you look at just one side of the coin, seeing a H makes you 67% sure that it is the trick coin. The reason is that seeing the head side is like flipping it once and getting a H.

We multiply by \\(\\lambda/\\lambda\\)\n\\(E(1/(X+1))=\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\sum_{x=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\lambda^{x+1}}{(x+1)!}e^{-\\lambda}\\)\nNow we can make a change of variables: \\(y=x+1\\) and thus \\(x=0\\) becomes \\(y=1\\)\n\\(E(1/(X+1)) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\sum_{y=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\lambda^{y}}{y!}e^{-\\lambda}\\)\nThe only thing missing is that the summation starts at \\(y=1\\) instead of \\(y=0\\), But for \\(Y \\sim Poisson(\\lambda)\\), \\(P(Y=0)=e^{-\\lambda}\\) so this summation is \\(1-e^{-\\lambda}\\).\n\\(E(1/(X+1)) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}(1-e^{-\\lambda})\\)\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(X\\) is \\(\\text{Bernoulli}(p)\\) and \\(Y\\) is \\(\\text{Bernoulli}(q)\\), computer \\(\\mathbb{E}\\left[(X+Y)^3\\right]\\) assuming \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\\((X+Y)^3 = X^3+3X^2Y+3XY^2+Y^3\\) so \\(E[(X+Y)^3]=E(X^3)+3E(X^2)E(Y)+3E(X)E(Y^2)+E(Y^2)\\)\nthis is due to independence. Since \\(X\\) an \\(Y\\) are independent, so are \\(X^2\\) and \\(Y\\), and \\(X\\) and \\(Y^2\\). \\(E(X)=E(X^2)=E(X^3)=p\\) and \\(E(Y)=E(Y^2)=E(Y^3)=q\\). Thus \\(E[(X+Y)^3]=p+6pq+q\\)\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(X\\) be a random variable with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). Let \\(\\Delta(\\theta)=\\mathbb{E}\\left[(X-\\theta)^2\\right]\\).

Recall that \\(Var(X)=E(X^2)-\\mu^2\\) so \\(E(X^2)=\\sigma^2+\\mu^2\\) So we can write \\(\\Delta(\\theta)=\\sigma^2 + \\mu^2-2\\theta\\mu + \\theta^2\\) We want to find what value of \\(\\theta\\) minimizes this function - derivative! \\(\\Delta'(\\theta)=-2\\mu+2\\theta=0\\) thus \\(\\theta=\\mu\\) minimizes this.\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) are independent uniform random variables in \\(\\{0,1,\\ldots,100\\}\\).

This is the same calculation for each \\(i\\). So \\(P(Y&gt;l)=\\dfrac{(100-l)^n}{101^n}\\).\n\n\n\n\nConsider a binomial random variable \\(X\\) with parameters \\(n\\) and \\(p\\). \\(p_X(k)={n \\choose k} p^k(1-p)^{n-k}\\).

It’s the equivalence of \\(k{n \\choose k}=n{n-1 \\choose k-1}\\). We make this subsitution\n\\(\\sum_{k=1}^n n{n-1 \\choose k-1} p^k(1-p)^{n-k}=np\\sum_{k=1}^n {n-1\\choose k-1}p^{k-1}(1-p)^{n-k}\\)\nWe could write \\(n-k=(n-1)-(k-1)\\) and we’ll be making some substitutions: \\(m=n-1\\) and \\(j=k-1\\). This lets us write\n\\(np\\sum_{j=0}^m {m \\choose j}p^j(1-p)^{m-j}=np\\) because the summation =1, as it is just the sum of the pmf of a binomial.\n\n\n\n\n(not for 340) Consider a geometric random variable \\(X\\) with parameter \\(p\\). \\(p_X(k)=p(1-p)^k\\) for \\(k=0,1,\\ldots\\).

In this model, the risky underlying follows, under risk neutrality, a geometric Brownian motion with a stochastic differential equation (SDE).\nWe will look at the discretized version of the BSM model (Euler discretization), given by \\(S_t = S_{t-\\Delta t} \\exp\\left(\\left(r - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\right)\\Delta t + \\sigma\\sqrt{\\Delta t}z_t \\right).\\)\nThe variable \\(z\\) is a standard normally distributed random variable, \\(0 &lt; \\Delta t &lt; T\\), a (small enough) time interval.

    "text": "12.13 Battleship\nBuild a Battleship AI (https://github.com/mitchelljy/battleships_ai)\n(Rules of the game: https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/battleship.pdf)\nBattleship is a game played on 10x10 grid. There are 5 boats of lengths 2, 3, 3, 4, and 5. The Monte Carlo AI is built like this:\n\nTake current board state\nSimulate \\(N\\) samples, each is a random placement of a remaining ships (knowing where hits and misses have been observed.) . Be sure to not put boats in a space that has been guessed, and if a hit has been found, be sure that boats cover those spots.\nStack all of the simulations and sum the total number of ships in each square (emphasise ships that overlap existing hits)\nTake the mean for each sqaure, giving us a frequency matrix or heatmap\nPick the largest value corresponding to a legal move in the matrix\n\nThis is how the AI decides which square to guess at every state of the game. As an added challenge, you can create additional logic to have the computer make the guess - taking the spot that has the highest likelihood - and determine if it is a hit, or if it sinks a boat. You will need to initialize the board with a random arrangement of the boats.\n\nYou will need a function generate_board &lt;- function(width=10, height=10, boats=c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE)). This function should randomly place boats on the board, each either vertically or horizontally, and return The layout. Number the boats 1,2,3,4,5. Be sure that numbers do not overlap each other when placed randomly. This function should return a matrix with values 0 if there is nothing placed in a spot, or the boat number. For example, when you place boat 5, it is 5 units long, so there should be 5 spots with the number 5 in them (And they should be in a straight line).\nYou will also need a function validate_board &lt;- function(board, state) which will check to see if the simulated board is legal given the state. The state should have 0s in locations that have not been tested, -1 in locations where misses have been numbers 1 through 5 where hits have been observed. If the number of \\(i\\)’s on the board equals the number of pegs in boat \\(i\\), then the AI will now that boat \\(i\\) has been sunk - you can convert all of these \\(i\\)’s into -1 so they will be ignored, and in the future we can dispance with randomly placing boat \\(i\\). A board is valid if there are no boats in a -1 spot, and any spot in an \\(i\\) spot contains boat \\(i\\).\nTo determine the next move you will need to generate boards until you have had at least 1 valid board (10 is better) to make a choice. If many spots have the same frequency, then you can just pick one at random, or pick the one with the lowest row and column.\n\nSee an implementation here",

Then the average slowly approaches 0 again until another extreme value throws everything off.

Behind one of the doors is the grand prize (a million dollars, a new car, a MacGuffin; use your imagination). Behind the other two doors are goats (in this hypothetical universe, a goat is not a prize you want; I disagree with this sentiment, but that’s beside the point). You get to choose a door, and you win the prize behind that door.\nHere’s a helpful illustration from Wikipedia:\n\n\n\nImage credit Wikipedia; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem\n\n\nSuppose that you choose a door at random. Having chosen that door, the host Monty Hall opens one of the other doors to reveal a goat (i.e., not the Grand Prize), and Monty Hall offers you a choice: you can stick with the door you chose and win whatever prize is behind that door, or you can switch your choice to the other door, which Monty Hall has not yet opened.\nShould you switch your choice of door?\nOn first glance, most people agree that it should make no difference– your original choice of door was random, so whether you switch your guess or not, you’re still equally likely to have chosen the door with the Grand Prize.\nBut this intuition is incorrect! Let’s check with a simulation, first.\n\ngenerate_game_state &lt;- function() {\n  # Generate a random instance of the Monty Hall game.\n  # That is, a random assignment of prizes to doors\n  # and an initial guess for our contestant.\n  # Generate an assignment of prizes/goats to doors.\n  # We'll encode the Grand Prize as a 1 and the goats as 0s.\n  # Reminder: sample(v) just returns a random permutation\n  # of the entries of v.\n  prizes &lt;- sample( c(1,0,0) );\n  # Now, let's randomly pick a door to guess.\n  # We pick door number 1, 2 or 3.\n  # Use sample() to choose from {1,2,3} uniformly at random\n  doors &lt;- c(1,2,3)\n  guess &lt;- sample( doors, size=1);\n  # Record the other two doors.\n  # x[-c] returns the entries of x NOT in vector c.\n  otherdoors &lt;- doors[-guess];\n  \n  # Return a list object, which will be easier to work with\n  # when we want to access the different pieces of game\n  # information\n  game &lt;- list(prizes=prizes, guess=guess,\n               otherdoors=otherdoors );\n  return( game )\n}\n\nrun_game_noswitch &lt;- function() {\n  # Run one iteration of Let's Make a Deal,\n  # in which we do NOT switch our guess.\n  \n  # Generate a game.\n  game &lt;- generate_game_state()\n  # Now, Monty Hall has to reveal a door to us.\n  # If we were switching our guess, we would need to do some\n  # extra work to check some conditions (see below for that),\n  # but since we're not switching, let's just cut to the\n  # chase and see if we won the prize or not.\n  # Remember, game$prizes is a vector of 0s and 1s, encoding\n  #     the prizes behind the three doors.\n  # game$guess is 1, 2 or 3, encoding which door we guessed\n  return( game$prizes[game$guess] )\n}\n\nrun_game_yesswitch &lt;- function() {\n  # Run one iteration of Let's Make a Deal,\n  # in which we DO switch our guess.\n  \n  # Generate a game.\n  game &lt;- generate_game_state()\n  guess &lt;- game$guess; # We're going to switch this guess.\n  # Now, Monty Hall has to reveal a door to us.\n  # To do that, we need to look at the other doors,\n  # and reveal that one of them has a goat behind it.\n  # game$otherdoors is a vector of length 2, encoding the\n  # two doors that we didn't look at.\n  # So let's look at them one at a time.\n  # Note: there are other, more clever ways to write\n  # this code, but this is the simplest implementation\n  # to think about, in my opinion.\n  if( game$prizes[game$otherdoors[1]]==0 ){\n    # The first non-guessed door doesn't have a goat\n    # behind it, so Monty Hall shows us the goat behind\n    # that door, and we need to switch our guess to the\n    # *other* door that we didn't choose.\n    guess &lt;- game$otherdoors[2];\n  } else {\n    # If the Grand Prize is behind otherdoors[1],\n    # so that game$otherdoors[1]]==1,\n    # then Monty Hall is going to show us a goat behind\n    # otherdoors[2], and we have the option to switch our\n    # guess to otherdoors[1],\n    # and we will exercise that option\n    guess &lt;- game$otherdoors[1];\n  }\n  # Now check if we won the prize!\n  return( game$prizes[guess] )\n}\n\nOkay, we’ve got simulations implemented for both of our two different game strategies. Let’s simulate both of these a bunch of times and compare the long-run average success.\n\nM &lt;- 1e4;\nnoswitch_wins &lt;- 0;\nfor(i in 1:M) {\n  noswitch_wins &lt;- noswitch_wins + run_game_noswitch()\n}\n\nnoswitch_wins/M\n\n[1] 0.3357\n\n\nNow, let’s see how we do if we switch our guesses.\n\nM &lt;- 1e4;\nyesswitch_wins &lt;- 0;\nfor(i in 1:M) {\n  yesswitch_wins &lt;- yesswitch_wins + run_game_yesswitch()\n}\n\nyesswitch_wins/M\n\n[1] 0.665\n\n\nWow! That’s a lot better than the strategy where we don’t switch our guess!\nThis discrepancy can be explained using Bayes’ rule, but it gets a bit involved (see the wikipedia page if you’re really curious).\nInstead, let’s just think about the following: suppose that the Grand Prize is behind door number 1. There are three possibilities, all equally likely (because we chose uniformly at random among the three doors):\n\nWe pick door 1. We have chosen the door with the Grand Prize behind it. In this situation, the other two doors both have goats behind them, and Monty Hall reveals one of those two goats to us. In this situation, we (mistakenly, so sad!) switch our Grand Prize door for a goat door and we lose.\nWe pick door 2. We have chosen a door with a goat behind it. Of the other two doors, only one has a goat, door 3. Monty Hall shows us the goat behind that door, and we switch our guess to the other door, door 1, which has the Grand Prize behind it. Hooray!\nWe pick door 3. We have chosen a door with a goat behind it. Of the other two doors, only one has a goat, door 2. Monty Hall shows us the goat behind that door, and we switch our guess to the other door, door 1, which has the Grand Prize behind it. Hooray!\n\nSo, of the three equally likely situations, we win the Grand Prize in two of them, and our probability of winning is thus \\(2/3\\). Compare that with our \\(1/3\\) probability of winning in the situation where we don’t switch doors. Not bad!\nThe important point here is that our decision to switch doors is made conditional upon the information from Monty Hall that eliminates one of the three doors for us.\n\n\n10.3.5 A Combination of Random Variables\nLet X be the product of 3 normal random variables Y1, Y2 and Y3, with means 3, 6, and -2 and standard deviations 5, 6 and 9\nWhat is Pr[X &lt; 13]?\n\nNMC&lt;- 100000\nresults &lt;- rep(0, NMC)\nfor(i in 1:NMC){\n  Y1 &lt;- rnorm(1, 3, 5)\n  Y2 &lt;- rnorm(1, 6, 6)\n  Y3 &lt;- rnorm(1, -2, 9)\n  X &lt;- Y1*Y2*Y3\n  results[i] &lt;- (X &lt; 13)\n}\nmean(results)\n\n[1] 0.60955\n\n\n\n\n10.3.6 Example A complicated random variable\nRoll 3 6-sided dice and multiply their values.

    "text": "3.2 Probability refresher\nA random experiment (or random process) is a procedure which produces an uncertain outcome. The set of possible outcomes is often denoted \\(\\Omega\\).\n\nWhen we flip a coin, it can land either heads (\\(H\\)) or tails (\\(T\\)), so the outcomes are \\(\\Omega = \\{H, T\\}\\).\nWhen we roll a six-sided die, there are six possible outcomes, \\(\\Omega = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\).\nIn other settings, the outcomes might be an infinite set.\n\nEx: if we measure the depth of Lake Mendota, the outcome may be any positive real number (theoretically)\n\n\nUsually \\(\\Omega\\) will is discrete (e.g., \\(\\{1,2,\\dots\\}\\)) or continuous (e.g., \\([0,1]\\)). We call the associated random variable discrete or continuous, respectively.\nA subset \\(E \\subseteq \\Omega\\) of the outcome space is called an event.\nA probability is a function that maps events to numbers, with the properties that\n\n\\(\\Pr[ E ] \\in [0,1]\\) for all events \\(E\\)\n\\(\\Pr[ \\Omega ] = 1\\)\nFor \\(E_1,E_2 \\in \\Omega\\) with \\(E_1 \\cap E_2 = \\emptyset\\), \\(\\Pr[ E_1 \\cup E_2 ] = \\Pr[ E_1 ] + \\Pr[ E_2 ]\\)\n\nIf \\(\\Pr[E_1 \\cap E_2]=0\\), we say that \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) are mutually exclusive (or disjoint)\nTwo events \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) are independent if \\(\\Pr[ E_1 \\cap E_2 ] = \\Pr[ E_1 ] \\Pr[ E_2 ]\\).\n\n3.2.1 Example: Coin flipping\nConsider a coin toss, in which the possible outcomes are \\(\\Omega = \\{ H, T \\}\\).\nThis is a discrete random experiment. If we have a fair coin, then it is sensible that \\(\\Pr[ X=1 ] = \\Pr[ X=0 ] = 1/2\\).\nExercise (optional): verify that this probability satisfies the above properties!\nWe will see in a later lecture that this is a special case of a Bernoulli random variable, which you are probably already familiar with.\n\n\n3.2.2 Example: Six-sided die\nIf we roll a die, the outcome space is \\(\\Omega = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\), and the events are all the subsets of this six-element set.\nSo, for example, we can talk about the event that we roll an odd number \\(E_{\\text{odd}} = \\{1,3,5\\}\\) or the event that we roll a number larger than \\(4\\), \\(E_{&gt;4} = \\{5,6\\}\\).\n\n\n3.2.3 Example: Human heights\nWe pick a random person and measure their height in, say, centimeters. What is the outcome space?\n\nOne option: the outcome space is the set of positive reals, in which case this is a continuous random variable.\nAlternatively, we could assume that the outcome space is the set of all real numbers.\n\nHighlight: the importance of specifying our assumptions and the outcome space we are working with in a particular problem.\n\n\n3.2.4 A note on models, assumptions and approximations\nNote that we are already making an approximation– our outcome sets aren’t really exhaustive, here.\n\nWhen you toss a coin, there are possible outcomes other than heads and tails: it is technically possible to land on the edge.\nSimilarly, perhaps the die lands on its edge.\n\nHuman heights:\n\nWe can only measure a height to some finite precision (say, two decimal places), so it is a bit silly to take the outcome space to be the real numbers.\nAfter all, if we can only measure a height to two decimal places, then there is no way to ever obtain the event, “height is 160.3333333… centimeters”.\n\nGood to be aware of these approximations - but they usually won’t bother us.",

Let \\(D\\) denote the (random) outcome of the die roll, and let \\(C\\) denote the (random) outcome of the coin flip. So \\(D \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\) and \\(C \\in \\{1,0\\}\\).

These events should not be independent.\nLet’s verify that \\[\n\\Pr[ E_1 \\cap E_2 ] \\neq \\Pr[ E_1 ] \\Pr[ E_2 ].\n\\]\nThere are six sides on our die, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and three of those sides are even numbers, so \\(\\Pr[ E_1 ] = 1/2\\).\nThe probability that the die lands showing 3 is exactly \\(\\Pr[ E_2 ] = 1/6\\).\nPutting these together, \\(\\Pr[E_1] \\Pr[E_2] = 1/12\\).\nOn the other hand, let’s consider \\(E_1 \\cap E_2\\) (the die is even and it lands showing three). These two events cannot both happen!\nThat means that \\(E_1 \\cap E_2 = \\emptyset\\). Thus \\(\\Pr[ \\emptyset ] = 0.\\)\n(Aside: why? Hint: \\(\\Pr[ \\Omega ] = 1\\) and \\(\\emptyset \\cap \\Omega = \\emptyset\\); now use the fact that the probability of the union of disjoint events is the sum of their probabilities).\nSo we have \\[\n\\Pr[ E_1 \\cap E_2 ] = 0 \\neq \\frac{1}{12} =\\Pr[ E_1 ] \\Pr[ E_2 ].\n\\]\nOur two events are indeed not independent.\n\n\n3.3.3 Mutually Exclusive vs Independent\nTwo events \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) are mutually exclusive if the probability of both occurring simultaneously is zero \\[P(E_1 \\cap E_2) = 0\\]\nCould two events \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) with non-zero probabilities be mutually exclusive and independent?

    "text": "3.4 Conditional probability\nWe can’t talk about events and independence without discussing conditional probability.\nTo motivate this, consider the following: suppose I roll a six-sided die. What is the probability that the die lands showing 2?\nNow, suppose that I don’t tell you the number on the die, but I do tell you that the die landed on an even number (i.e., one of 2, 4 or 6). Now what is the probability that the die is showing 2?\nWe can work out the probabilities by simply counting possible outcomes. Are the probabilities the same?\n\n3.4.1 Example: disease screening\nHere’s a more real-world (and more consequential example): suppose we are screening for a rare disease. A patient takes the screening test, and tests positive. What is the probability that the patient has the disease, given that they have tested positive for it?\nWe will need to establish the rules of conditional probability before we can tackle a problem such as this.\n\n\n3.4.2 Introducing conditional probability\nThese kinds of questions, in which we want to ask about the probability of an event given that something else has happened, require that we be able to define a “new kind” of probability, called conditional probability.\nLet \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be two events.\n\nExample: \\(A\\) could be the event that a die lands showing 2 and \\(B\\) is the event that the die landed on an even number.\nExample: \\(A\\) could be the event that our patient has a disease and \\(B\\) is the event that the patient tests positive on a screening test.\n\nProvided that \\(\\Pr[ B ] &gt; 0\\), we define the conditional probability of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\), written \\(\\Pr[ A \\mid B]\\), according to \\[\n\\Pr[ A \\mid B ] = \\frac{ \\Pr[ A \\cap B ] }{ \\Pr[ B ] }.\n\\] Note that if \\(\\Pr[B] = 0\\), then the ratio on the right-hand side is not defined, hence why we demanded that \\(\\Pr[B] &gt; 0\\).\nLet’s try computing one of these conditional probabilities: what is the probability that the die is showing 2 conditional on the fact that it landed on an even number?\nWell,\n\n\\(\\Pr[ \\text{ even } ] = 1/2\\), because there are three even numbers on the die, and all six numbers are equally likely: \\(3/6 = 1/2\\).\n\\(\\Pr[ \\text{ die lands 2 } \\cap \\text{even} ] =  \\Pr[ \\text{ die lands 2 }]\\), since \\(2\\) is an even number.\n\nSo the conditional probability is \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Pr[ \\text{ die lands 2 } \\mid \\text{ even }]\n&= \\frac{ \\Pr[ \\text{ die lands 2 } \\cap \\text{even} ] }{ \\Pr[ \\text{ even } ] } \\\\\n&= \\frac{ \\Pr[ \\text{ die lands 2 }]}\n    { \\Pr[ \\text{ even } ] } \\\\\n&= \\frac{ 1/6 }{ 1/2 } = 1/3.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] This makes sense– given that the die lands on an even number, we are choosing from among three outcomes: \\(\\{2,4,6\\}\\). The probability that we choose \\(2\\) from among these three possible equally-likely outcomes is \\(1/3\\).\n\n\n3.4.3 Example: disease screening (continued)\nWhat about our disease testing example? What is the probability that our patient has the disease given that they tested positive?\nWell, applying the definition of conditional probability, \\[\n\\Pr[ \\text{ disease} \\mid \\text{ positive test }]\n= \\frac{ \\Pr[ \\text{ disease} \\cap \\text{ positive test }] }{ \\Pr[ \\text{positive test} ] }\n\\]\nOkay, but what is \\(\\Pr[ \\text{ positive test} ]\\)? I guess it’s just the probability that a random person (with the disease or not) tests positive? For that matter, what is \\(\\Pr[ \\text{ disease} \\cap \\text{ positive test }]\\)? These can be hard events to assign probabilities to! Luckily, there is a famous equation that often gives us a way forward.\n\n\n3.4.4 Bayes’ rule\nThe Reverend Thomas Bayes was the first to suggest an answer to this issue. Bayes’ rule, as it is now called, tells us how to relate \\(\\Pr[ A \\mid B]\\) to \\(\\Pr[ B \\mid A]\\): \\[\n\\Pr[ A \\mid B ] = \\frac{ \\Pr[ B \\mid A ] \\Pr[ A ]}{ \\Pr[ B ]}.\n\\]\nThis is useful, because it is often easier to write one or the other of these two probabilities.\nApplying this to our disease screening example, \\[\n\\Pr[ \\text{ disease} \\mid \\text{ positive test }]\n=\n\\frac{ \\Pr[\\text{ positive test } \\mid \\text{ disease}]\n        \\Pr[ \\text{ disease}]}\n        { \\Pr[ \\text{ positive test } ]  }\n\\]\nThe advantage of using Bayes’ rule in this context is that the probabilities appearing on the right-hand side are all straight-forward to think about (and estimate!).\n\n\\(\\Pr[ \\text{ disease}]\\) is the just the probability that a randomly-selected person has the disease. This is known as the prevelance of the diseases in the population. We could estimate this probability by randomly selecting a random group of people and determining if they have the disease (hopefully not using the screening test we are already using…).\n\\(\\Pr[\\text{ positive test } \\mid \\text{ disease}]\\) is the probability that when we give our screening test to a patient who has the disease in question, the test returns positive. This is often called the sensitivity of a test, a term you may recall hearing frequently in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\\(\\Pr[ \\text{ positive test } ]\\) is just the probability that a test given to a (presumably randomly selected) person returns a positive result. We just said about that this is the hard thing to estimate.\n\n\n\n3.4.5 Example: testing for a rare disease\nSuppose that we are testing for a rare disease, say, \\[\n\\Pr[ \\text{ disease}] = \\frac{1}{10^6},\n\\]\nand suppose that a positive test is also rare, in keeping with the fact that our disease is rare and our test presumably has a low false positive rate: \\[\n\\Pr[ \\text{ positive test} ] = 1.999*10^{-6}\n\\] Note that this probability actually depends on the sensitivity \\(\\Pr[\\text{ positive test } \\mid \\text{ disease}]\\) and the specificity \\(1-\\Pr[\\text{ positive test } \\mid \\text{ healthy}]\\) of our test. You’ll explore this part more on your homework, but we’re just going to take this number as given for now.\nFinally, let’s suppose that our test is 99.99% accurate: \\[\n\\Pr[\\text{ positive test } \\mid \\text{ disease}]\n= 0.9999 = 1-10^{-4}\n\\]\nTo recap, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Pr[ \\text{ disease}] &= \\frac{1}{10^6} \\\\\n\\Pr[ \\text{ positive test} ] &= 1.999*10^{-6} \\\\\n\\Pr[\\text{ positive test } \\mid \\text{ disease}]\n&= 0.9999.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNow, suppose that a patient is given the screening test and receives a positive result. Bayes’ rule tells us \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Pr[ \\text{ disease} \\mid \\text{ positive test }]\n&=\n\\frac{ \\Pr[\\text{ positive test } \\mid \\text{ disease}]\n        \\Pr[ \\text{ disease}]}\n        { \\Pr[ \\text{ positive test } ]  }\n= \\frac{ 0.9999 * 10^{-6} }{ 1.999*10^{-6} } \\\\\n&= 0.5002001.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSo even in light of our positive screening test result, the probability that our patient has the disease in question is still only about 50%!\nThis is part of why, especially early on in the pandemic when COVID-19 was especially rare, testing for the disease in the absence of symptoms was not considered especially useful.\nMore generally, this is why most screenings for rare diseases are not done routinely– doctors typically screen for rare diseases only if they have a reason to think a patient is more likely to have that disease for other reasons (e.g., family history of a genetic condition or recent exposure to an infectious disease).\n\n\n3.4.6 Calculating the denominator in Bayes’ Rule\nThe denominator can be decomposed into two parts using a property known as the Law of Total Probability.\n\\[\n\\Pr[ \\text{ positive test} ] = \\Pr[ \\text{ positive test} \\cap \\text{disease}]+\\Pr[ \\text{ positive test} \\cap \\text{no disease}]\n\\]\nIn other words, all positive results are either true positives or false positives. Because these are mutually exclusive events, the total probability of a positive result is the probability of a true positive plus the probability of a false positive. We can expand each of these terms using the conditional probability rule.\n\\[\n\\Pr[ \\text{ positive test} \\cap \\text{disease}] = \\Pr[\\text{ positive test } \\mid \\text{ disease}]  \\Pr[ \\text{ disease}]\n\\] \\[\n\\Pr[ \\text{ positive test} \\cap \\text{no disease}] = \\Pr[\\text{ positive test } \\mid \\text{ no disease}]  \\Pr[ \\text{no disease}]\n\\]\nFor example, suppose that a genetic condition occurs in roughly 1 out of 800 individuals. A simple saliva test is available. If a person has the gene, the test is positive with 97% probability. If a person does not have the gene, a false positive occurs with 4% probability.\nTo simplify notation, let \\(G\\) represent “the individual has the gene” and \\(G'\\) be the complementary event that “the individual does not have the gene.” Furthermore, let \\(Pos\\) and \\(Neg\\) represent the test results.\nIf a random person from the population takes the test and gets a positive result, what is the probability they have the genetic condition?\nBayes’ Rule to the rescue:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP[G | Pos] &= \\dfrac{P[Pos | G] P[G]}{P[Pos | G] P[G] + P[Pos | G'] P[G']}\\\\\n&= \\dfrac{(.97)(1/800)}{(.97)(1/800)+(.04)(799/800)}\\\\\n&\\approx 0.0295\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] In other words, a positive test result would raise the likelihood of the gene being present from \\(1/800=0.00125\\) up to \\(.0295\\).\n\n\n3.4.7 Dependent free throw shots\nSuppose a basketball player’s likelihood of making a basket when making a free throw depends on the previous attempt. On the first throw, they have a probability of \\(0.67\\) of making the basket. On the second throw, following a basket the probability goes up to \\(.75\\). If the first throw is a miss, the probability of a basket on the second throw goes down to \\(0.62\\).\nExercise: If the second throw is a basket, what is the likelihood the first throw is a basket?\nExercise: Given that the player scores at least 1 point, what is the probability that they score 2 points total?",

    "text": "3.5 Random Variables\nConsider the following quantities/events:\n\nWhether or not a coin flip comes up heads or tails.\nHow many people in the treatment group of a vaccine trial are hospitalized.\nThe water level measured in Lake Mendota on a given day.\nHow many customers arrive at a store between 2pm and 3pm today.\nHow many days between installing a lightbulb and when it burns out.\n\nAll of these are examples of events that we might reasonably model according to different random variables.\nInformal definition of a random variable: a (random) number \\(X\\) about which we can compute quantities of the form \\(\\Pr[ X \\in S ]\\), where \\(S\\) is a set.\n\n3.5.1 Random variables (formal definition)\nA random variable \\(X\\) is specified by an outcome set \\(\\Omega\\) and a function that specifies probabilities of the form \\(\\Pr[ X \\in E ]\\) where \\(E \\subseteq \\Omega\\) is an event. For our purposes though it’s helpful to think of a random variable as a variable that can take random values with specified probabilities.\nBroadly speaking random variables fall into two categories: discrete and continuous. A discrete random variable can take a value from a countable set (for example, the integers). The set of possible values could be finite or possibly infinite. A continuous random variable can take any real number value along an interval (or union of intervals).\n\n\n3.5.2 Discrete Random Variables\n\n3.5.2.1 Probability Mass Function\nTo define a discrete random variable it is enough to define a function mapping possible values to their probabilities. This is known as a probability mass function (pmf). It can be represented in a table or mathematically.\nFor example, suppose the random variable \\(X\\) can take values \\(0,1,2,3\\) or \\(4\\). We could define the probability mass function using a table:\n\n\n\n\\(k\\)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\n\\(Pr[X=k]\\)\n.10\n.15\n.20\n.30\n.25\n\n\n\nAnother random variable \\(Y\\) may be defined as taking any non-negative integer \\(k\\geq0\\), with \\[Pr[Y=k]=(.6)(.4^k)\\]\n\n\n3.5.2.2 The Cumulative Distribution Function\nWe are often interested not just in the probability that a random variable \\(X\\) takes one particular value \\(k\\), but a value within a range. From a probability mass function \\(f(k)=Pr[X=k]\\) we can define a cumulative distribution function (cdf) \\(F(k)\\). \\[F(k) = Pr[X \\leq k] = \\sum_{x \\leq k}Pr[X=x]\\] (we can just add up these probabilities since they are disjoint events).\n\n\n3.5.2.3 CDF example\nFor example, we can expand the pmf from the previous example to a cdf.\n\n\n\n\\(k\\)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\n\\(Pr[X=k]\\)\n.10\n.15\n.20\n.30\n.25\n\n\n\\(F(k)\\)\n.10\n.25\n.45\n.76\n1.0\n\n\n\nNotice that the cdf increases (technically it is “non-decreasing”) as \\(k\\) increases, going from 0 to 1 and no higher. While the table above only gives cdf values for integers, it is technically a step function defined for all real numbers. The cdf would be 0 for any value \\(k\\) lower than the lowest possible value of \\(X\\).",

    "text": "3.6 Expectation\nBefore we continue with more random variables, let’s take a pause to discuss one more important probability concept: expectation. You will hopefully recall from previous courses in probability and/or statistics the notion of expectation of a random variable.\nExpectation: long-run averages\nThe expectation of a random variable \\(X\\), which we write \\(\\mathbb{E} X\\), is the “long-run average” of the random variable.\nWhat we would see on average if we observed many realizations of \\(X\\).\nThat is, we observe \\(X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_n\\), and consider their average, \\(\\bar{X} = n^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\).\n\n3.6.1 Expected value and the Law of Large Numbers (first peek)\nThe law of large numbers (LLN) states that in a certain sense, as \\(n\\) gets large, \\(\\bar{X}\\) gets very close to \\(\\mathbb{E} X\\).\nWe would like to say something like \\[\n\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i = \\mathbb{E} X.\n\\] But \\(n^{-1} \\sum_i X_i\\) is a random sum, so how can we take a limit?\nRoughly speaking, for \\(n\\) large, with high probability, \\(\\bar{X}\\) is close to \\(\\mathbb{E}\\).\n\n\n3.6.2 Expectation: formal definition\nMore formally, if \\(X\\) is a discrete random variable, we define its expectation to be \\[\n\\mathbb{E} X = \\sum_k k \\Pr[ X = k],\n\\] where the sum is over all \\(k\\) such that \\(\\Pr[ X=k ] &gt; 0\\).\n\nNote that this set could be finite or infinite.\nIf the set is infinite, the sum might not converge, in which case we say that the expectation is either infinite or doesn’t exist. But that won’t be an issue this semester.\n\nQuestion: can you see how this definition is indeed like the “average behavior” of \\(X\\)?\n\n\n3.6.3 Example: Calculating Expectation\nCalculate the expected value of the random variable \\(X\\) with the pmf\n\n\n\n\\(k\\)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\n\\(Pr[X=k]\\)\n.10\n.15\n.20\n.30\n.25\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6.4 LLN Important take-away\nThe law of large numbers says that if we take the average of a bunch of independent RVs, the average will be close to the expected value.\n\nSometimes it’s hard to compute the expected value exactly (e.g., because the math is hard– not all sums are nice!)\nThis is where Monte Carlo methods come in– instead of trying to compute the expectation exactly, we just generate lots of RVs and take their average!\nIf we generate enough RVs, the LLN says we can get as close as we want.\nWe’ll have lots to say about this in our lectures on Monte Carlo methods next week.",

    "text": "3.7 Continuous random variables\nContinuous random variables, which take values in “continuous” sets like the interval \\([0,1]\\) or the real \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\nContinuous random variables have probability density functions, which we will usually write as \\(f(x)\\) or \\(f(t)\\).\nThese random variables are a little trickier to think about at first, because it doesn’t make sense to ask about the probability that a continuous random variable takes a specific value. That is, \\(\\Pr[ X = k ]\\) doesn’t really make sense when \\(X\\) is continuous (actually– in a precise sense this does make sense, but the probability is always zero; you’ll see why below).\n\n3.7.1 The probability density function\nRather than defining the probability measure for specific values \\(k\\) that the random variable can take, it only makes sense to describe the relative likelihood of different values. We use a probability density function (pdf) to do this. The pdf, typically denoted \\(f(x)\\) defines the how much probability per unit is to be found at \\(X=x\\).\nLet’s look at an example.\n\n\n3.7.2 PDF Example\nDefine continuous rv \\(X\\) with density function \\(f(x)=.5x\\) for \\(x \\in [0,2]\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7.3 Calculating probabilities for continuous RVs\nProbability can be calculated by integration: For some interval \\([a,b]\\) we calculate \\[Pr\\left[a\\leq X\\leq b\\right] = \\int_a^b f(x)dx\\]\nBecause the definite integral correspond to the area under the curve, we can sometimes find probabilities using geometry rather than calculus.\nExample: Calculate \\(Pr[.5 \\leq X \\leq 1.5]\\).\n\n\n3.7.4 Probability that X=k?\nBecause of how we define probability for continuous random variables, \\(Pr[X=k]=\\int_k^k f(x)dx=0\\), so there is no measurable probability for any one particular value for a continuous random variable. Therefore we can say \\(Pr[X &lt; k]\\) or \\(Pr[X \\leq k]\\). It doesn’t matter since \\(Pr[X=k]=0\\).\n\n\n3.7.5 CDF for a continuous random variable\nThe CDF is defined as \\(F(x) = Pr[X \\leq x]\\) (using \\(x\\) instead of \\(k\\) for now). This is the same definition for continuous random variables, but mathematically it arises from an integral rather than a summation: \\[F(x) = Pr[X \\leq x] = \\int_{-\\infty}^x f(t)dt\\] For this course we won’t be integrating density functions. On occasion you’ll be provided with a cdf but you won’t have to produce them yourself.\nBut it’s worth noting that \\(F(x) \\in [0,1]\\) for all random variables, and \\(F(x)\\) is a non-decreasing function, with \\(F(x)\\to0\\) as \\(x \\to -\\infty\\), and \\(F(x)\\to 1\\) as \\(x \\to +\\infty\\).\n\n\n3.7.6 Expectation for continuous random variables\nPreviously, we defined the expectation of a discrete random variable \\(X\\) to be \\[\n\\mathbb{E} X = \\sum_k k \\Pr[ X = k ],\n\\] with the summand \\(k\\) ranging over all allowable values of \\(X\\). When \\(X\\) is continuous how should we define the expectation? Change the sum to an integral!\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E} X = \\int_\\Omega t f(t) dt,\n\\]\nwhere \\(f(t)\\) is the density of \\(X\\) and \\(\\Omega\\) is the support.\nThis type of exercise is best left to another statistics course. For us it’s enough to think of the expectation as a balancing point (center of mass) for a continuous random variable’s distribution function.",

    "text": "3.8 Random Variables and Independence\nTwo random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent if for all sets \\(S_1,S_2\\), we have \\(\\Pr[ X \\in S_1 ~\\&~ Y \\in S_2 ] = \\Pr[ X \\in S_1 ] \\Pr[ Y \\in S_2 ]\\).\nRoughly speaking, two random variables are independent if learning information about one of them doesn’t tell you anything about the other.\n\nFor example, if each of us flips a coin, it is reasonable to model them as being independent.\nLearning whether my coin landed heads or tails doesn’t tell us anything about your coin.\n\n\n3.8.1 Independent Random Variables\nInformally, we’ll say that two random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent if any two events concerning those random variables are independent.\nThat is, for any event \\(E_X\\) concerning \\(X\\) (i.e., \\(E_X = \\{ X \\in S \\}\\) for \\(S \\subseteq \\Omega)\\) and any event \\(E_Y\\) concerning \\(Y\\), the events \\(E_X\\) and \\(E_Y\\) are independent.\ni.e., if two random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent, then for any two sets \\(S_1, S_2 \\subset \\Omega\\), \\[\n\\Pr[ X \\in S_1, Y \\in S_2 ]\n=\n\\Pr[ X \\in S_1] \\Pr[ Y \\in S_2 ].\n\\] \nIf \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are both discrete, then for any \\(k\\) and \\(\\ell\\), \\[\n\\Pr[ X=k, Y=\\ell ]\n=\n\\Pr[ X=k ] \\Pr[ Y=\\ell ].\n\\]\nSimilarly, if \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are continuous, then the joint density has the same property: \\[\nf_{X,Y}(s,t) = f_X(s) f_Y(t).\n\\]\n\n\n3.8.2 How reasonable is independence?\nIn most applications, it is pretty standard that we assume that our data are drawn independently and identically distributed according to some distribution. We say “i.i.d.”. For example, if \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n\\) are all continuous uniform random variables between 0 and 1, we would say \\[\nX_i \\overset{\\text{iid}}{\\sim} \\text{Uniform}(0,1), \\text{ for } i=1,\\ldots, n\n\\]\nThis notation is common to denote iid random variables.\nAs another example, when we perform regression (as you did in STAT240, and which we’ll revisit in more detail later this semester), we imagine that the observations (i.e., predictor-response pairs) \\((X_1,Y_1),(X_2,Y_2),\\dots,(X_n,Y_n)\\) are independent.\nMost standard testing procedures (e.g., the t-test) assume that data are drawn i.i.d.\nHow reasonable are these assumptions?\nIt depends on where the data comes from! We have to draw on what we know about the data, either from our own knowledge or from that of our clients, to assess what assumptions are and aren’t reasonable.\nLike most modeling assumptions, we usually acknowledge that independence may not be exactly true, but it’s often a good approximation to the truth!\nExample: suppose we are modeling the value of a stock over time. We model the stock’s price on days 1, 2, 3, etc as \\(X_1, X_2, X_3, \\dots\\). What is wrong with modeling these prices as being independent of one another? Why might it still be a reasonable modeling assumption?\nWhat if instead we look at the change in stock price from day to day? For example, let \\(Y_i = X_{i+1}-X_{i}\\). In other words, \\(X_{i+1}=X_i+Y_i\\). Would it be more reasonable to assume that the \\(Y_i\\)’s are independent?\nWhat if instead of considering a stock’s returns on one day after another, we look at a change in stock price on one day, then at the change 10 days from that, and 10 days from that, and so on? Surely there is still dependence, but a longer time lag between observations might make us more willing to accept that our observations are close to independent (or at least have much smaller covariance!).\nNote: Tobler’s first law of geography states ‘Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.’ Does that ring true in this context?\nExample: suppose we randomly sample 1000 UW-Madison students to participate in a survey, and record their responses as \\(X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_{1000}\\). What might be the problem with modeling these responses as being independent? Why might be still be a reasonable modeling assumption?\n\n\n3.8.3 (in)dependence, expectation and variance\nRecall the definition of the expectation: If \\(X\\) is continuous with density \\(f_X\\), \\[\n\\mathbb{E} X = \\int_\\Omega t f_X(t) dt,\n\\]\nand if \\(X\\) is discrete with probability mass function \\(\\Pr[ X=k]\\), \\[\n\\mathbb{E} X = \\sum_{k \\in \\Omega} k \\Pr[X=k]\n\\]\nWith the expectation defined, we can also define the variance, \\[\n\\operatorname{Var} X = \\mathbb{E} (X - \\mathbb{E} X)^2\n= \\mathbb{E} X^2 - \\mathbb{E}^2 X.\n\\]\nThat second equality isn’t necessarily obvious– we’ll see why it’s true in a moment.\nNote: we often write \\(\\mathbb{E}^2 X\\) as short for \\((\\mathbb{E} X)^2\\).\nA basic property of expectation is that it is linear. For any constants (i.e., non-random) \\(a,b \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), \\[\n\\mathbb{E} (a X + b) = a \\mathbb{E} X + b.\n\\] If \\(X,Y\\) are random variables, then \\[\n\\mathbb{E}( X + Y) = \\mathbb{E} X + \\mathbb{E} Y.\n\\]\nNote that derivatives and integrals are linear, too. For example, \\[\n(a ~f(t) + b ~g(t))' = a ~ f'(t) + b ~g'(t)\n\\]\nand \\[\n\\int(a f(t) + b g(t)) dt = a \\int f(t) dt + b \\int g(t) dt\n\\]\nBecause expected value is simply an integral (or summation), the linearity of expectation follows directly from the definition.\nExercise: prove that \\(\\mathbb{E} (a X + b) = a \\mathbb{E} X + b\\) for discrete r.v. \\(X\\).\nExercise: prove that \\(\\mathbb{E}( X + Y) = \\mathbb{E} X + \\mathbb{E} Y\\) for discrete \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\nExercise: Use the linearity of expectation to prove that \\(\\mathbb{E} (X - \\mathbb{E} X)^2\n= \\mathbb{E} X^2 - \\mathbb{E}^2 X\\). Hint: \\(\\mathbb{E}( X \\mathbb{E} X) = \\mathbb{E}^2 X\\) because \\(\\mathbb{E} X\\) is NOT random– it pops right out of the expectation just like \\(a\\) does in the equation above.\nThe definition of variance and the linearity of expectation are enough to give us a property of variance:\nFor any constants (i.e., non-random) \\(a,b \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), \\[\n\\operatorname{Var} (a X + b) = a^2 \\operatorname{Var} (X).\n\\]\nExercise: Use the definition \\(\\operatorname{Var}(X)=\\mathbb{E} X^2 - \\mathbb{E}^2 X\\) to prove the above.\nThis linearity property implies that the expectation of a sum is the sum of the expectations: \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[ X_1 + X_2 + \\dots + X_n]\n= \\mathbb{E} X_1 + \\mathbb{E} X_2 + \\dots + \\mathbb{E} X_n.\n\\]\nHowever, the variance of the sum the is not always the sum of the variances.\nConsider RVs \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{Var}(X + Y)\n&= \\mathbb{E}[ X + Y - \\mathbb{E}(X + Y) ]^2 \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{E}[ (X - \\mathbb{E} X) + (Y - \\mathbb{E} Y) ]^2,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere the second equality follows from applying linear of expectation to write \\(\\mathbb{E}(X+Y) = \\mathbb{E}X + \\mathbb{E}Y\\).\nNow, let’s expand the square in the expectation. \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{Var}(X + Y)\n&=\n\\mathbb{E}[ (X - \\mathbb{E} X) + (Y - \\mathbb{E} Y) ]^2 \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{E}[(X - \\mathbb{E} X)^2 + 2(X - \\mathbb{E} X)(Y - \\mathbb{E} Y)\n              + (Y - \\mathbb{E} Y)^2 ] \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{E} (X - \\mathbb{E} X)^2 + 2 \\mathbb{E} (X - \\mathbb{E} X)(Y - \\mathbb{E} Y) + \\mathbb{E} (Y - \\mathbb{E} Y)^2,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where the last equality is just using the linearity of expectation.\nNow, the first and last terms there are the variances of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\): \\[\n\\operatorname{Var} X = \\mathbb{E}(X - \\mathbb{E} X)^2,~~~\n\\operatorname{Var} Y = \\mathbb{E}(Y - \\mathbb{E} Y)^2.\n\\]\nSo \\[\n\\operatorname{Var}(X + Y)\n= \\operatorname{Var} X + 2 \\mathbb{E} (X - \\mathbb{E} X)(Y - \\mathbb{E} Y)\n  + \\operatorname{Var} Y.\n\\]\nThe middle term is (two times) the covariance of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), often written \\[\n\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)\n= \\mathbb{E}( X - \\mathbb{E}X)( Y - \\mathbb{E} Y).\n\\]\nIf \\(\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = 0\\), then \\[\n\\operatorname{Var}(X + Y) = \\operatorname{Var} X + \\operatorname{Var} Y.\n\\]\nBut when does \\(\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = 0\\)?\nIf \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent random variables, then \\(\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = 0\\) (but causality does not work the other way)\nNote: We will skip the proof that independence of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) implies \\(Cov(X,Y)=0\\), but you can find this proof in many places online.\n\n\n\n3.8.4 (Un)correlation and independence\nCovariance might look familiar to you from a quantity that you saw in STAT240 (and a quantity that is very important in statistics!). The (Pearson) correlation between random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is defined to be \\[\n\\rho_{X,Y} = \\frac{ \\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) }{ \\sqrt{ (\\operatorname{Var} X)(\\operatorname{Var} Y)} }.\n\\]\nNote that if \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent, then \\(\\rho_{X,Y}=0\\) and we say that they are uncorrelated.\nBut the converse isn’t true– it is possible to cook up examples of random variables that are uncorrelated (i.e., \\(\\rho_{X,Y} = 0\\)), but which are not independent.\n\n\n3.8.5 Example: Uncorrelated but not independent\nSuppose \\(X\\) can take three values: \\(-1, 0,\\) and \\(1\\) with probabilities \\(.25, .5\\) and \\(.25\\). We can define a second random variable \\(Y=X^2\\). You can see from the definition that \\(Y\\) is most definitely dependent on \\(X\\). If, for example, you know that \\(x=1\\), then you know that \\(y=1^2=1\\).\nWith a little bit of work, we can show that \\(EX=0, EY=.5\\), \\(VarX=.5\\) and \\(VarY=.25\\) (do this as an exercise!)\nWhat is the covariance?\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nCov(X,Y)  &= E((X-EX)(Y-EY)) \\\\\n          &= E((X-0)(X^2-.5)) \\\\\n          &= E(X^3-.5X)\\\\\n          &= EX^3 - .5EX\\\\\n          &= EX - 0\\\\\n          &= 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] (Note that \\(Y=X^2\\) and \\(X^3=X\\))\n\\(Cov(X,Y)=0\\) but \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are not independent.",

    "text": "4.4 Disease Screening\nSay that the flu is currently infecting 3% of the population (prevelance). A person can take a flu test that has a sensitivity of 99% (i.e. if they have the virus, there is a 99% chance the test will give a positive result) and a specificity of 95% (i.e. if they don’t have the virus, there’s a 95% chance the test gives them a negative result).\nThe sensitivity is also known as the True positive rate (TPR). The complement of specificity is the False Positive Rate (FPR), and in this case it is 1-.95=.05 or 5%.\nSo a person takes the test and gets a positive test result, what is the probability that they actually have the flu? (This is known as the positive predictive value or PPV)\n\np.flu &lt;- .03; p.noflu &lt;- 1-p.flu\np.pos.given.flu &lt;- .99; p.neg.given.flu &lt;- 1-p.pos.given.flu\np.neg.given.noflu &lt;- .95; p.pos.given.noflu &lt;- 1-p.neg.given.noflu\n\n# P(flu | pos) = P(flu)*P(pos|flu)/ [P(flu)*P(pos|flu) + P(noflu)*P(pos|noflu) ]\np.flu*p.pos.given.flu / (p.flu*p.pos.given.flu + p.noflu*p.pos.given.noflu)\n\n[1] 0.3797954\n\n\nSurprising? Well, if we didn’t do the test we’d guess a 5% chance of flu. Now that the test results are in that estimation increases by more than 7x to about 38%. Why isn’t it higher? There is a high chance of false positives muddying the waters.\nThe negative predictive value is the probability they truly do not have the flu if they get a negative test result.\n\n# P(no flu | neg) = P(no flu) * P(neg | no flu) / [ P(no flu) * P(neg|no flu) + P(flu) * P(neg|flu)]\n(1-p.flu)*p.neg.given.noflu / ((1-p.flu)*p.neg.given.noflu + (p.flu)*p.neg.given.flu)\n\n[1] 0.9996745\n\n\nVery high - but remember that 97% of the population does not have the flu. A negative test result has raised our subjective likelihood of no flu from 97% up to 99.97% - there’s still a chance this was a false negative but its not likely because the base rate of the flu is small to begin with."

    "text": "2.5 Topics covered\nWe will cover five basic topics this semester:\n\nSampling\nEstimation\nTesting\nPrediction\nObservational/exploratory data analysis\n\nLet’s briefly discuss each of these.\n\n2.5.1 Sampling\nElection polls and other survey data often get reported with response rates and other details about how survey respondents were selected.\nExample: At the end of October 2020, pollsters were trying to predict the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. A common technique for this is “random digit dialing”, which is exactly what it sounds like.\nThis poll reached 806 registered voters in Wisconsin. After a significant amount of statistical work, the pollsters reported that\n\n48% of likely voters would choose Biden\n43% would vote for Trump\n2% for Jorgensen, and\n7% remained undecided.\n\nIn order to reach those 806 participants, many more numbers need to be dialed. In this poll, the response rate was 4.3%. If you read the methodology report, you’ll see that in fact over 100,000 numbers had to be dialed to get these 806 respondents. The vast majority of those 100,000 calls were never picked up. Among those who did pick up, 806 were registered voters and agreed to participate in the survey, but another were 1113 refused to participate (or hung up).\nIn the actual election,\n\nBiden received 49.45% of votes cast in Wisconsin and\nTrump received 48.82%.\n\nQuestions:\n\nHow does this compare with the predicted vote shares of 48% for Biden and 43% for Trump?\nHow might we explain the discrepancies?”\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Testing\nYou have no doubt heard that “correlation does not imply causation”. Well, this is true.\n\nIce cream consumption is correlated with drowning, but we don’t think that ice cream causes drowning.\nHospitals are full of sick people, but we don’t think that hospitals cause sickness.\n\nNonetheless, to paraphrase a relevant comic, causality often does give awfully strong hints.\n\n\n\nCredit: Randall Munroe, XKCD (https://xkcd.com/552)\n\n\nExample: On November 16, 2020 Moderna released results from their phase 3 clinical trial for their COVID-19 vaccine.\nThere were approximately 30,000 people in the trial, split (approximately) evenly between treatment (got the vaccine) and control (got a placebo).\n\nIn total, there were 95 cases of COVID-19 among the participants; 90 among the placebo group and 5 among the treated group.\nOf the 95 cases, 11 were severe cases, all in the placebo group.\n\nIn this study, vaccination is correlated with reduced risk of infection.\n\nDoes this mean that the vaccination causally reduced COVID-19 infection? Why or why not?\nHow do we know that we aren’t fooling ourselves when we say that the Moderna vaccine is effective?\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Estimation\nThe news is perpetually full of stories about different economic indicators and how they are changing over time.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is meant to measure the change over time in prices of consumer goods and services.\nMost surveys (e.g., public opinion or election surveys) are reported with a +/- 3% “confidence interval” or “sampling error”.\n\nWhat is that all about?\nExample: In the Wisconsin poll discussed above, the margin of error was reported to be +/- 4.3%.\nRecall that the pollsters predicted 48% of likely voters would choose Biden and 43% Trump, while the actual outcome was 49.45% for Biden and 48.82% for Trump.\n\nIs this outcome within the stated margin of error?\nMore generally, what does it mean to give a confidence interval for a quantity of interest?”\n\n\n\n2.5.4 Prediction\nInvesting successfully (in real estate, stocks, etc) requires that we be able to predict the future behavior of an asset based on what we know about it currently.\n\nBased on the size of a house, its proximity to schools or infrastructure, walkability of its neighborhood, etc., we might hope to predict its “true” price.\nMany psychology and sociology studies aim to predict future student outcomes based on performance on a standardized test\n\nIn these kinds of problems, our goal is to predict an outcome or response (e.g., house price) based on one or more predictors (e.g., square footage of the house).\nMost of machine learning is concerned with prediction problems. For example, labeling an image according to whether or not it contains a cat can be stated as a prediction problem.\nExample: this plot shows different people’s incomes (in tens of thousands of dollars per year) as a function of their years of education.\n\n\n\nEducation by income\n\n\nIt certainly looks like more years of education correlate with higher income.\nQuestion: Suppose I tell you that someone has 18 years of education. What would you predict their income to be?\n\n\n2.5.5 Observational/exploratory data analysis\nSuppose that a colleague or client gives you a data set that looks like this:\n\nWhat would you do? There is clearly some kind of a cluster structure present here.\nThe goal of exploratory data analysis is to identify interesting structures in our data that might warrant further study.\nExample: In my own research, I (Keith) collaborate a lot with neuroscientists, who are interested in identifying functional subnetworks of the brain. These are groups of neurons that work together, typically because they are associated with the same activity (e.g., attention, motion, speech).\nThis is an example of clustering, in which our goal is to group data points in a sensible way, without necessarily saying ahead of time what those groups mean\nOftentimes, we obtain observational data. That is, data that does not come from a carefully-designed experiment.\nExample: Much data in the modern age of “big data” is collected by scraping the web or collected in other “messy” ways.\n\nScraping data from a social media site such as Twitter.\nMeasuring the socioeconomic status of people in different zip codes\n\nThere are lots of interesting scientific questions we might like to ask about such a data set, but because this data isn’t the result of a carefully-controlled experiment, we are often much more limited in what we can say."

    "section": "2.6 World, Data, Model (hat tip to Karl Rohe)",
    "text": "2.6 World, Data, Model (hat tip to Karl Rohe)\nUnless you subscribe to some rather outlandish philosophical beliefs (see, e.g., here), there is a world out there, which we would like to learn about.\nTo figure things out about the world, we take measurements. That is to say, we collect data. These data describe the world, but it remains to build a model that explains how these data came to be.\nThe process of inference is how we use a specific set of data to guide our beliefs about the world.\nAs a simple example, consider human height. What is the average adult human height?\nThis is a question about the world. In fact, we could compute the average adult human height exactly if we could go out and measure the height of every adult human.\n\nOf course this would be a complicated and expensive process.\nInstead, we could just measure the heights of a few adult humans (say, a few thousand).\n\nOf course, this small collection of humans would need to be chosen randomly and in such a way that they would be representative of the population as a whole, but let’s ignore that concern until later in the course.\nThe few thousand heights that we measure would constitute our data– measurements that were taken out there in the world.\nHere is a simulation of what that data might look like with a sample of size 2000.\n\n# heights.R contains code for generating our synthetic data set.\nsource('r_scripts/heights.R');\n\nLoading required package: ggplot2\n\npp &lt;- ggplot( df_heights, aes(x=heights ) );\npp &lt;- pp + geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), fill=\"grey\", color=\"black\", binwidth=2, );\npp &lt;- pp + geom_vline(xintercept=mean(heights), color=\"black\", linetype='f8', linewidth=1);\npp\n\n\n\n\nThe vertical dashed line indicates the mean of these 2000 sampled heights.\nBecause this is a random sample (and because heights vary due to factors like nutrition and genetics), this sample mean need not be equal to the population mean (i.e., the true average adult human height).\nInstead, the heights in our sample (and their mean) will vary randomly about the population average height. We use a statistical model (i.e., probability theory) to describe this variation.\nA common choice for modeling random variation like this is the normal distribution (in the coming lectures we will see plenty of other distributions).\nWe assume that our data are generated by a normal distribution with some mean \\(\\mu\\) (i.e., the average height) and some standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). We call these parameters of the model.\nEstimating the population average height then reduces to estimating the “true” value of the parameter \\(\\mu\\) based on the data.\nThis step of using our data to determine something about our model is called inference. In this case, our goal is to estimate the value of the model parameter \\(\\mu\\), which will in turn be our estimate of the average adult human height."

    "text": "2.7 All models are wrong, but some are useful\nAn important point in our human height example above was our assumption that heights are normally distributed. In practice, modeling assumptions like these are never strictly true.\nOur model is just that– a model of the world; a set of simplifying assumptions that we hope are at least a good approximation to the truth.\nThink of your physics courses, where we assume that things happen in a frictionless void and use Newtonian mechanics instead of quantum mechanics.\nWe make assumptions like these because they often make the math easier while still being a good approximation to reality.\nIn our example above, the normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) says that with some (perhaps very small) probability, we might observe a negative number.\nIf we model human heights as being normally distributed, our model predicts that we should, on occasion, meet people who have negative height.\n\nWhy might that be a problem?\nWhy might it be okay to still use this model anyway?\n\nLet’s push ahead and “fit” a normal to our data. We’ll have lots to say about this later. For now, think of this as choosing, out of all the possible normal distributions, the one that “best agrees”” with our data.\n\n# The dataframe df_normal contains a column of x-values in the same range as our synthetic data.\n# df_normal$y contains the normal pdf with mean and standard deviation fit to our synthetic data,\n# evaluated at these x-values.\npp &lt;- pp + geom_line( aes(x=df_normal$x, y=df_normal$y), size=1, color='red' );\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\npp\n\n\n\n\nHuh. Our data seems to be a bit “flatter” than the normal distribution would predict.\nPerhaps this is just due to random fluctuation, but in fact there is a very simple reason for this: We didn’t tell you about it, but this sample includes both males and females.\nLet’s plot the same histogram, but this time, let’s break out the heights according to sex.\n\npp &lt;- ggplot( df_heights, aes(x=heights, color=sex, fill=sex ) );\npp &lt;- pp + geom_histogram( aes(y=..density..), position=\"identity\", alpha=0.5, binwidth=2);\npp\n\n\n\n\nHuman heights are bimodal– female heights are approximately normal about some mean, and male heights are approximately normal about another.\nWe can fit a normal to each of these separately and we see that our model agrees with the data much better.\n\n# df_bimodal$x contains x values that agree with the range of our height data.\n# df_bimodal$density is the density of a normal distribution, fit to the male or female heights,\n#        evaluated at these x-values.\n# df_bimodal$sex encodes male/female\\n\",\npp &lt;- pp + geom_line(data=df_bimodal, aes(x=x, y=density, color=sex), size=2, alpha=0.5);\npp\n\n\n\n\nThis is a good (albeit simple) illustration of the kind of iterative workflow that we typically use in data science.\n\nWe obtain our data, fit a model to it, and then we examine the shortcomings of that model.\nAfter some thought, it becomes clear how to improve our model.\nWe implement those changes (in this case, we incorporated the variable sex into our model), and examine our findings again.\n\nTypically, we repeat this cycle several times before reaching a conclusion that we are confident in."
